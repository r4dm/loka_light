# Overview of the Loka Light Project

## Introduction

**Loka Light** is a research project and a Python software library that implements the concept of *N‑polar* information flow beyond ordinary binary logic. The idea is that signals can be distributed across N different poles (states) instead of the standard two states (±), while supporting a special “Σ balancing” mechanism—control of the total contribution across all poles[[1]](https://github.com/r4dm/loka_light#:~:text=,component%20is%20removed%20before%20decoding). The project offers a compact toolkit for working with such multipolar signals, including algebraic models, simulators of physical devices, and “pseudo‑quantum” simulations. As a result, Loka Light combines mathematical rigor with physical intuition, enabling experiments with multi‑valued signal systems, modeling the propagation of light/waves, and even reproducing selected effects of quantum physics on a classical computer.

## Algorithms and Mathematical Models

At the core of Loka Light is a new *multipolar algebra* that extends binary logic to N states. The base class LokaCn describes a system with *N poles* (e.g., N=4 with poles “A, B, C, D”), and the value object MultipolarValue stores a distribution of quantities across those poles[[1]](https://github.com/r4dm/loka_light#:~:text=,component%20is%20removed%20before%20decoding). The algebra defines addition/combination operations for such multipolar quantities and tracks the total contribution Σ. Unlike binary signals, where a value is defined as \+1 or –1, a multipolar value is a distribution vector—for example *(A:1.0, C:–1.0)*—which, under **collapse** (the collapse() method), can be mapped to a more familiar form (e.g., a complex number) while preserving the structure of the Σ sum. Thus, LokaCn and MultipolarValue provide rigorous mathematical rules for operating on N‑pole signals and control the system’s total “charge”[[1]](https://github.com/r4dm/loka_light#:~:text=,component%20is%20removed%20before%20decoding).

To ensure correct information transfer in multipolar cascades, special **Σ signal purification** algorithms are introduced. The project defines M/N/NX stages—conceptual signal-processing phases: first, the M block forms a multipolar signal, then at the N stage or the extended NX stage the aggregate component is corrected[[1]](https://github.com/r4dm/loka_light#:~:text=,component%20is%20removed%20before%20decoding). This *pseudo‑multipolar cascade* processing controls Σ and, using the SigmaGuard device class, drives the sum to zero (Σ→0) before final decoding[[1]](https://github.com/r4dm/loka_light#:~:text=,component%20is%20removed%20before%20decoding). In other words, SigmaGuard subtracts the common component (an analog of a DC term) from the pole distribution, which is mathematically equivalent to removing an offset or “common mode” of the signal—similar to how, in physics, a DC offset is removed to obtain a balanced signal.

Additionally, Loka Light contains a modeling layer inspired by quantum mechanics. The MultiConjugateFunction class defines a state with complex amplitudes to which multiple “conjugate” copies of the state (*n\_conjugates*) can be applied. It defines a scalar probability\_density(), computed as the sum **Σ|ψ|^k** (where *k* \= *n\_conjugates*), and a tensor probability\_tensor() function for obtaining a multidimensional distribution[[2]](https://github.com/r4dm/loka_light#:~:text=label%2C%20not%20a%20full%203D,for%20simple%20%E2%80%9Cquantum%E2%80%91like%E2%80%9D%20experiments). In the standard quantum case, at *n\_conjugates \= 2* the density function matches the sum of squared amplitudes (the Born rule), reproducing the probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics. However, the model allows varying the k parameter, which in theory generalizes the probability metric (e.g., k=1 would give a linear sum of magnitudes, while k\>2 would correspond to hypothetical “super‑quantum” regimes). This apparatus implements algorithms analogous to applying quantum operators: the library includes, for example, functions to emulate the Hadamard transform, phase shift, and measurement for one “qubit” (see the *Pseudo-Quantum CPU Simulator* section). Thus, Loka Light’s mathematical toolkit covers both a generalization of classical signals (multipolar logic) and an imitation of quantum states, providing functions for computing probability distributions and observable quantities in experimental scenarios.

## Implementing Physical Principles

Despite the abstract nature of multipolar algebra, the project strives for a physical interpretation of its models. In particular, a multipolar signal can be likened to a **multiphase electrical signal** or a light wave with multiple components. The requirement Σ=0 (zero total polarity) corresponds to the balance characteristic of multiphase systems: for example, in a three‑phase electrical circuit, the algebraic sum of currents can equal zero under a symmetric load. By removing the common component, the SigmaGuard algorithm is analogous to a physical device that eliminates a DC term or the signal’s common mode to prevent receiver saturation. This improves transmission fidelity because the receiver operates on a **differential signal**, where useful information is encoded in oppositely directed components rather than in the common background.

**Wave propagation modeling.** Loka Light includes a simplified imitation of an electromagnetic signal transmission chain. The scenarios use a *volumetric path*, consisting of an oscillation generator, transmit and receive antennas, and a conditional propagation medium[[3]](https://github.com/r4dm/loka_light#:~:text=,a%20full%203D%20field%20model). Specifically, a multipolar oscillator (MultipolarOscillator) generates a signal at a given frequency, which is fed into a transmitter (MultipolarTransmitter)—modeled with a gain factor and optional attenuation (losses) specified in decibels[[4]](https://github.com/r4dm/loka_light#:~:text=,by%20the%20receiver%20for%20compatibility). The signal passes through the medium (e.g., free space, where the geometry\_profile parameter acts as a simple scenario label) and is received by a receiver (MultipolarReceiver). The receiver is tuned to the same frequency (the WaveMetadata.frequency\_hz parameter) for proper demodulation[[4]](https://github.com/r4dm/loka_light#:~:text=,by%20the%20receiver%20for%20compatibility). It is important to note that *geometry\_profile* serves only as an indicator of geometry (e.g., line of sight) and **does not perform a full 3D field computation**—the medium is modeled in a simplified way, without solving Maxwell’s equations[[3]](https://github.com/r4dm/loka_light#:~:text=,a%20full%203D%20field%20model). Nevertheless, the presence of gain, loss, and frequency parameters makes it possible to capture key physical effects: signal attenuation during propagation and the need for transmitter/receiver frequency matching.

**Multipolar circuit elements.** The library demonstrates how ordinary electrical components can be generalized to N‑pole versions. For example, NBranchInductor represents an inductor with multiple taps (branches), and MultiPlateCapacitor is a capacitor with many plates. The combination of one inductor branch (e.g., *L*, n\_branches=1) and a two‑plate capacitor (*C*, n\_plates=2) forms an oscillatory circuit that becomes a 4‑pole system when connected to NPoleMind(n=4)—an abstract 4‑pole “mind” model[[5]](https://github.com/r4dm/loka_light#:~:text=python%20,detectors%20import%20MultipolarReceiver). The code shows how two such identical oscillatory circuits can operate synchronously: one in the transmitter (osc\_tx), the other in the receiver (osc\_rx), while *MultipolarTransmitter* and *MultipolarReceiver* provide signal transmission and reception between them[[5]](https://github.com/r4dm/loka_light#:~:text=python%20,detectors%20import%20MultipolarReceiver)[[4]](https://github.com/r4dm/loka_light#:~:text=,by%20the%20receiver%20for%20compatibility). Physically, this is an analog of a multipole LC oscillator capable of exciting several oscillation modes simultaneously. Although the model is simplified (nonlinear effects, radiation into space, and mutual induction are not computed explicitly), this approach demonstrates how the principles of electromagnetic oscillations can be embedded into multipolar logic.

**Pseudo‑quantum experiments.** The built‑in simulator of quantum effects based on multipolar states deserves special attention. Using MultiConjugateFunction to store amplitudes, Loka Light implements simple quantum circuits on the CPU—for example, applying the Hadamard matrix, a phase shift, and an inverse Hadamard to a state, followed by measurement. This is equivalent to the classic interference experiment with a single photon or a single‑qubit system. The resulting measurement probability distribution (counts of 0 and 1\) follows the laws of quantum theory with the appropriate parameter settings (k=2) and number of trials (*shots*)[[6]](https://github.com/r4dm/loka_light#:~:text=,optional%20%7D%29%20PY). In addition, the project allows testing the principles of quantum nonlocality: scenarios compute CHSH and CGLMP indicators—numerical Bell-inequality values for entangled states (CHSH for qubits, CGLMP for higher-dimensional states)[[7]](https://github.com/r4dm/loka_light#:~:text=Writes%20,same%20seed%2F%CE%B5). Although “entanglement” here is modeled classically (via probabilistic correlations between two parts of the system), comparing the obtained values with theoretical bounds shows how *multipolar noise* affects quantum criteria. For example, Loka Light distinguishes between random noise that **preserves Σ=0** and ordinary independent noise, showing that the former is less destructive to quantum correlations[[7]](https://github.com/r4dm/loka_light#:~:text=Writes%20,same%20seed%2F%CE%B5). This approach bridges statistical signal models with fundamental principles of physics—from electrical engineering to quantum theory.

## Results and Project Demonstrations

The Loka Light authors prepared a series of demonstration scenarios illustrating how the algorithms and models work. These scenarios are implemented as Python functions (under the loka\_light.applications.scenarios namespace) and generate output data (JSON, NPZ) that capture key system metrics. Below are some examples of simulations and their results:

* **Multipolar data transmission**: the *Secure Transmission Chain* scenario simulates sending a digital sequence through a multipolar channel. Message bits are first encoded into a distribution across N poles (the M block), then pass through a Σ purification stage (the N/NX block), after which the signal is transmitted through a “medium” from transmitter to receiver[[8]](https://github.com/r4dm/loka_light#:~:text=Note%20on%20regimes%3A%20the%20secure,the%20common%20component%20before%20decoding). This chain demonstrates how combining multipolar coding with removal of the common component makes it possible to reliably recover the original data on the receive side. The report file includes, in particular, a **trace of the Σ sum** at different stages and the final decoded result—the index of the strongest pole after Σ purification[[9]](https://github.com/r4dm/loka_light#:~:text=Writes%20%60runs%2Fpseudo_mnx_chain%2Ftrace.json%60%20with%20the%20,decoded%20index%20after%20%CE%A3%20purification). This confirms the effectiveness of the M→N→NX→RX cascade: after each NX segment, |Σ| decreases, and in the end the decoder correctly identifies the transmitted symbol.

* **Dynamic cascade and time series**: the *Pseudomultipolar Time-Series Cascade* scenario generates a random time series of multipolar signals and passes it through repeated NX stages. As a result, it computes metrics for the monotonicity of Σ evolution and the receiver output error. The analysis shows that cascaded Σ filtering can maintain system stability as the signal propagates over time. Another related example is the *Translation Gap* scenario: it quantitatively assesses **information loss when projecting an N‑pole signal onto a binary (2‑pole) one**. The output captures visibility and loss metrics for such a basis mismatch after Σ purification[[10]](https://github.com/r4dm/loka_light#:~:text=Writes%20,2%E2%80%91pole%20projection%20after%20%CE%A3%20purification). These experiments are important for understanding how multipolar systems can be integrated with existing binary systems and what distortions arise.

* **Interference and quantum behavior**: in the *Pseudo-Quantum H→Phase→H→Measure* scenario, a characteristic single‑qubit quantum experiment is reproduced. The state is initialized, then a Hadamard operator, a phase shift by a chosen angle (e.g., \~π/3), and another Hadamard are applied, after which a measurement is performed in the ${|0\>,|1\>}$ basis. The simulation is run repeatedly (a few hundred *shots*), and the frequency of 0/1 outcomes is recorded. In the report, this scenario **outputs a measurement histogram** (the outcome probability distribution), also tracks Σ changes at each stage of the quantum chain, and saves a snapshot of the final state before measurement[[6]](https://github.com/r4dm/loka_light#:~:text=,optional%20%7D%29%20PY). The resulting histogram agrees with theoretical quantum-mechanics predictions: outcome probabilities depend on the introduced phase, showing interference peaks and dips. This confirms that the multipolar model can simulate wave (particle) superposition and interference with high accuracy.

* **Nonlocality tests (Bell inequalities)**: the *Pseudo-Quantum Witness Pack* scenario is designed for more advanced quantum checks. It generates a dataset used to compute CHSH and CGLMP indicators—values that characterize the degree of Bell-inequality violation for bipartite systems (CHSH for two levels, CGLMP as a generalization to d‑level systems). The project demonstrates a comparative analysis: the output files provide computed CHSH/CGLMP values with **Σ-invariant noise** (noise that affects all poles equally and does not break the Σ balance) and with ordinary independent noise[[7]](https://github.com/r4dm/loka_light#:~:text=Writes%20,same%20seed%2F%CE%B5). The results show a difference *Δ* between the two noise cases, suggesting that preserving the overall sum in the disturbance leads to less degradation of quantum correlations. This experiment highlights a potential advantage of multipolar signals: certain types of noise may be less destructive to the system’s correlation (and possibly information) properties, which is valuable for communications and sensing applications that require high precision.

In addition to those listed, Loka Light includes other scenarios such as *Object Polarity Scan* (scanning an object to determine the true number of poles), *Electrolyser Stage* (updating the state of a model “electrolyser” using a multipolar approach), *Polarization Field Split* (splitting a field into polarization components), and *Property Transfer with Shared Mind* (transferring a property through a shared “multipolar mind”). These examples go beyond standard physics tasks and instead illustrate the breadth of the multipolar paradigm—from materials science to cognitive analogies. In all cases, simulation results are saved to machine‑readable files, making it possible to visualize relationships and verify conservation laws. A user can analyze, for example, signal spectra, total polarity evolution, probability distributions, and more using standard tools (Jupyter Notebooks, MATLAB/NumPy, etc.). Overall, the Loka Light project demonstrates clear numerical experiments confirming the viability of the proposed algorithms and their alignment with the behavior of real physical systems.

## Potential Scientific Applications

The concepts and tooling developed within Loka Light have a number of potential applications in science and technology:

* **Computer graphics and optics:** Modeling light while accounting for *polarization* and *multispectral* structure. Traditionally, light rendering uses three color channels (RGB) and scalar intensity, whereas a multipolar approach could extend this to an arbitrary number of components corresponding, for example, to different polarization states or light harmonics. This could improve the realism of visualizing complex optical effects—glints, birefringence, coherence. In addition, the *volumetric path model*[[3]](https://github.com/r4dm/loka_light#:~:text=,a%20full%203D%20field%20model), presented in Loka Light, provides a simplified way to simulate rays traveling through a medium with attenuation—this may be relevant to visualizing light beams in the atmosphere, fog, and transparent materials.

* **Visualization of physical processes:** Thanks to the ability to track aggregate quantities (Σ, energy, correlations) at every step, Loka Light can be used for educational visualization of phenomena. For example, using simulation data one can build interactive plots: signal attenuation versus distance, current balance in a multiphase circuit, interference patterns as a function of phase, Bell-inequality violations at different noise levels, and so on. This makes complex processes—from electrodynamics to quantum mechanics—more intuitive. Such a tool can be valuable in teaching physics and engineering, allowing students to experiment with **multi-valued systems** and immediately see the result.

* **Digital communications and signal processing:** Multipolar signals are promising for developing new communication schemes. Telecommunications already uses multilevel modulation (for example, quadrature amplitude modulation, QAM, with multiple bits per symbol). Loka Light generalizes this idea: an N‑pole code could potentially transmit even more information per symbol and be more robust to certain types of noise. For example, it shows that special processing (σ purification) reduces the impact of correlated noise[[7]](https://github.com/r4dm/loka_light#:~:text=Writes%20,same%20seed%2F%CE%B5). In the future, this could be applied to **robust or covert data transmission**: an outside observer expecting a binary signal would not be able to interpret a multipolar one correctly without knowing the decoding algorithm (a hint at transmission security). In addition, Σ balancing facilitates integration with differential communication lines and fiber‑optic channels, where it is important to avoid energy leakage into the common conductor or into unwanted modes.

* **Quantum computing and quantum information:** While Loka Light is not a full multi‑particle quantum simulator, it provides a convenient *testbed* for exploring quantum ideas. For example, quantum-communication researchers can use the project’s pseudo‑quantum scenarios for numerical experiments with Bell inequalities, different decoherence models (by tuning the k parameter or the noise types), and so on. This is especially useful when a **large statistical run** is needed—the classical CPU simulator of multipolar states can handle hundreds and thousands of shots faster than emulators of real quantum computers. Discovering relationships like “Σ-invariant noise vs. quantum nonlocality” may suggest new ways to protect entangled states from degradation or improve QMA (quantum multiple access) protocols.

* **Scientific research and interdisciplinary problems:** Loka Light essentially offers a new view of representing data and signals. This may find applications in neuroscience and cognitive science, where information can be encoded as a distribution of activity across many neuronal ensembles (an analogy to an N‑pole representation). Also, when modeling complex systems (sociological, economic), there is sometimes a need to go beyond binary models of “opposites” and account for several poles of opinion or state—formal *multipolarity* metrics[[1]](https://github.com/r4dm/loka_light#:~:text=,component%20is%20removed%20before%20decoding) from this project could underpin such models. Finally, the approach itself may stimulate the development of new computing schemes: **multi-valued logic elements and processors** that operate not on bits but on “polarons” (pole units of information). Combined with hardware implementations (e.g., multipole electronic components or optical systems with multiple stable states), this opens a path to devices with higher information density and new functions. Thus, Loka Light serves as a starting point for a wide range of research at the intersection of mathematics, physics, and computer science, offering both a mathematical model and its numerical verification in examples[[11]](https://github.com/r4dm/loka_light#:~:text=,a%20full%203D%20field%20model)[[2]](https://github.com/r4dm/loka_light#:~:text=label%2C%20not%20a%20full%203D,for%20simple%20%E2%80%9Cquantum%E2%80%91like%E2%80%9D%20experiments).

**Conclusion:** The Loka Light project demonstrates how the concept of signals and information can be generalized by introducing *multipolarity* instead of binary, while still maintaining a connection to real physical principles. Using rigorous mathematical constructs and validating them through simulations (electromagnetic paths, quantum‑like experiments, multi‑phase circuits), the authors provide a convincing illustration of the potential of such models. The review shows that Loka Light is not only theoretically interesting but also practically applicable for modeling complex systems where a binary approach is insufficient. Its algorithms and results pave the way toward a better understanding of multi‑component interactions—whether it is a beam of light passing through a prism, an electrical signal in a multiphase network, or entangled particles exchanging secret information. Loka Light certainly lays the foundation for further research into multi‑valued systems and expands our understanding of the nature of information in the physical world.
