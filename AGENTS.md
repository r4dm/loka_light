AGENTS guide for loka_light (theory-first, ultra-brief)

This is a conceptual orientation for AI agents (not an API manual).

## Purpose (what to model)
- N‑polar information flow beyond binary (+/−)
- Minimal blocks: mind, oscillator, coder, receiver
- Reproducible demos linking messages → waves

## Core (what exists)
- Multipolarity = distribution over N polarity axes
- MultipolarOscillator shapes multi‑conjugate waves
- PolarCoder maps integers 0…N−1 to basis distributions
- Wave carries amplitudes + light metadata

## Operational model (how to think)
1) Pick N and output mode
2) Transmitter(+MultipolarOscillator) encodes messages → wave
3) Focus on amplitude structure across polarities, not channels
4) Receiver checks compatibility and demodulates

## Minimal assumptions
- Messages in [0, N−1] (strict). No modulo unless explicit.
- Fixed N/frequency unless a dynamic key is used.
- Default demodulation = argmax → single index. For sequences, transmit stepwise.
- Demos aim to be deterministic and CI‑friendly.

## Heuristics (for agents)
- Reason over amplitude vectors, compare shapes
- For ordered exchange, send one message per transmission

## Limits (by design)
- Minimal phenomenology; not a full EM simulator
- Default decode is argmax; advanced decoding is out‑of‑scope
